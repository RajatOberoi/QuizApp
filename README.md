React + Vite Project
This repository provides a minimal setup for a React project using Vite, with HMR (Hot Module Replacement) and some ESLint rules. The app is deployed on Vercel, making it easy to preview and share.

Features
React with Vite for fast development and optimized builds
Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for a smoother development experience
ESLint for maintaining clean, consistent code
Deployment on Vercel
Environment Variables are used but not included in the repo for security
Setup and Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repo-url>
cd <repo-directory>
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Start the development server:

bash
Copy code
npm run dev
This will start the app on http://localhost:5173 (or the port configured in your .env).

Available Commands
npm run dev - Starts the development server
npm run build - Builds the app for production
npm run preview - Serves the production build for previewing
npm run lint - Runs ESLint to check for code quality
Deployment on Vercel
Connect Vercel to GitHub and import this repository.
Configure Environment Variables: In Vercel, navigate to your project settings and add any environment variables required (these should match what you’d have in a .env file for local development).
Deploy - Vercel will automatically detect Vite as the build tool and use the appropriate settings. Your app will be live on a generated URL.
Environment Variables
To keep sensitive information secure, environment variables are not included in this repository. You can create a .env file locally for development with the necessary variables (e.g., VITE_API_URL).

To add environment variables in Vercel:

Go to your project in Vercel.
Navigate to Settings > Environment Variables.
Add the key-value pairs you use in .env locally.
Plugins
This project uses one of two official plugins for React:

@vitejs/plugin-react - Uses Babel for Fast Refresh
@vitejs/plugin-react-swc - Uses SWC for Fast Refresh
Choose the plugin that best fits your needs and update your vite.config.js file accordingly.
